Create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) refers to the four major functions implemented in database applications.

Create - insertion of data
Retrieve - retrieval of data
Update - editing the data
Delete - remove the data

--------------------------------------------------

Retrieving a Result Set
keyword: SELECT

SELECT * FROM tableName;
SELECT tableName1.columnName1, tableName2.columnName2 FROM tableName;
SELECT columnName1, columnName2 FROM tableName;
SELECT columnName FROM tableName;
(you can interchange column positions)

--------------------
Querying Tables
clause - allows you to filter the results set instead of selecting all the information from the table.

WHERE - add a test or condition to filter the results set to only bring back the rows fulfilling that condition.
AND - combining a condition
OR - getting two conditions
BETWEEN - 
LIKE - keyword string search
% - wild card

SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year = 2000;
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year = 2000 AND name = "The Stuff";
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year = 2000 OR year = 2010;
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;

SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE name LIKE 'blue%'; - Start
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE name LIKE '%blue'; - Ends
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE name LIKE '%blue%'; - Contain a particular string

In the SQL, 
operators:
= equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than and equal to
<= less than and equal to

--------------------
Ordering the Result Set

ORDER BY

SELECT * FROM stuff ORDER BY year;
SELECT * FROM stuff ORDER BY year ASC; (ascending order)
SELECT * FROM stuff ORDER BY year DESC; (descending order)

SELECT * FROM stuff ORDER BY year DESC, stuff ASC;
Position matters here - what you ask first will be the basis for the positioning.

--------------------
Limiting the Result Set

LIMIT

SELECT * FROM stuff LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM stuff LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0; (counting starts at 0)
SELECT * FROM stuff LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
SELECT * FROM stuff LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

SELECT * FROM stuff LIMIT 20, 10; (first number: location number, second number is number limit)
eg. get the 21 to 30 items in stuff.

--------------------
Dealing with null
null - means data isn't present in the database (empty data)

"IS NULL"
"IS NOT NULL"

SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM stuff WHERE year IS NOT NULL ORDER BY year;
