MySQL server requires a configuration file in a special folder on your hard drive called etc
Not present on default install so we have to copy it there

Configuration file (config file) is a set of values in a file that a program uses to operate.
This can be changed to alter how the program operates.

Servers normally don't have a User interface - so this is the way to interact with the application.

Terminal:
sudo cp /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my-default.cnf /etc/my.cnf

>>cp means copy
>>we use sudo here since it a .cnf file 
>>it just means to copy this file to that file location

.cnf is a configuration file
